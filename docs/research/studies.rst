ML Problems and Techniques for NFV
==================================

In this study, we provide list of all the published works on ML problems in NFV.
The problems are bucketized into multiple categories - Correlation, Prediction, Anomaly Detection, Traffic Engineering, etc.
This work also describes the methods/algorithms, along with the dataset, that are used to solve these problems.
The inferences from the researcher are also added as comments.


Opensource Projects for ML in NFV
=================================

In this document, we provide a list of opensource tools and frameworks that can be used to solve AI/ML problems in NFV.
